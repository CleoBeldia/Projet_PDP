# Conception of a research and development project design

# Context 
----------------
As part of our first year of Master in Bioinformatics, our team made up of Maram Al Hassan, Cl√©o Berrehail, Ayse Ergun 
and Hanane Hassainia, had the opportunity to work on a 4 month project with the LABRI in Bordeaux. We aim to create a Web 
application which enables the visualization of landmarks (key-points) on beetle images in order to study the variation of the beetles morphology. 

# Usages
